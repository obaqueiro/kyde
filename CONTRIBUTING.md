# Contributing to Kyde

Thanks for taking a look. Kyde is a small, opinionated tool — a fast native git
commit/diff view — and contributions are welcome. The author is upfront about not
being a Rust expert, so PRs that explain the idiomatic way are appreciated. Be kind
about the `.clone()`s.

## Ground rules

- **If a feature adds a lot of bloat, it should be a plugin**, not core. Language
  highlighting is the model: gated behind a Cargo feature, off by default at the
  margins, collapses gracefully when absent. See `Cargo.toml [features]` and
  `src/plugins.rs`.
- **Speed is the whole point.** Anything on a per-keystroke, per-frame, or
  per-file-select hot path must stay fast. If you add such a path, add a `perf_*`
  guard test (see below).
- Keep the macOS-native, no-web, no-Electron, no-React constraint.

## Setup

Requires **Rust 1.96** (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` picks it up
automatically). On macOS, gpui compiles Metal shaders and needs Apple's Metal
Toolchain:

```sh
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain   # only if a build errors on it
```

On Linux you need gpui's backend dev libraries — see the `Install Linux deps` step
in `.github/workflows/build.yml` for the exact `apt` list.

```sh
cargo build                 # debug build
cargo run -- /path/to/repo  # run against any git repo (bare = Projects view)
cargo test                  # logic + perf guard tests
```

## Before you open a PR

CI runs these and will fail the PR otherwise, so run them locally first:

```sh
cargo fmt --all                         # then commit the result
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
```

A trim build is also checked in CI — if you touch the feature/grammar wiring,
verify it still compiles:

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features rust,json,toml
```

To run those checks automatically, enable the repo's git hooks once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

`pre-commit` formats staged Rust files (so a commit can't carry unformatted code into
CI); `pre-push` runs fmt-check + clippy `-D warnings` + tests before anything leaves your
machine. Skip a hook with `--no-verify` if you must.

## Tests

- Plain-Rust modules (`git.rs`, `diff.rs`, `highlight.rs`, `theme.rs`, `keymap.rs`,
  `plugins.rs`, `tree.rs`, `shellcmd.rs`, …) carry unit tests in their own
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` — this is a bin crate with no lib target, so tests live
  in-module, not in `tests/`.
- **Perf guards** are named `perf_*` (run just them with `cargo test perf`). They
  push a representative-sized input through a hot path and assert it finishes under
  a deliberately loose budget — the goal is catching algorithmic blowups (accidental
  O(n²), per-keystroke reparse), not 2× CI jitter. Don't tighten them to "realistic"
  numbers; that only makes them flaky.

## Commits & PRs

- Small, focused commits with a clear message. Reference an issue if there is one.
- The PR template will ask what changed and how you tested it — fill it in.
- New user-facing behavior should get a line in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.

## Code layout

`CLAUDE.md` is the deep map of the codebase — every module, the render flow, the
theme system, the plugin gates. Read it before a non-trivial change; it's the
fastest way to understand how a piece fits.
