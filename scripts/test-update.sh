#   ./scripts/test-update.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds dist/Kyde.app (the "installed" app).
#   2. Fabricates a *newer* release locally: a copy of the bundle with its Info.plist version
#      bumped to 9.9.9, zipped as the release asset, described by a fixture latest.json whose
#      asset URL is a file:// path. (No recompile — we're proving the download+swap mechanism,
#      and the bumped Info.plist is the on-disk marker that the swap actually happened.)
#   3. Launches dist/Kyde.app's binary directly with:
#        KYDE_VERSION_OVERRIDE=0.0.1      → the running app is "behind" any fixture
#        KYDE_UPDATE_FEED_URL=file://…    → "latest release" comes from the local fixture
#      so the update banner appears for v9.9.9.
#   4. You click "Update & Relaunch". The app downloads the fixture zip, swaps dist/Kyde.app
#      in place, and relaunches.
#   5. Press Enter back here; the script asserts dist/Kyde.app's on-disk version is now 9.9.9.
#
# The swap targets whatever bundle current_exe() resolves to — here dist/Kyde.app — so a real
# install elsewhere is never touched.
